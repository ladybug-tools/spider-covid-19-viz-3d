<summary>Concept</summary>

The concept of the web page is to show you the current COVID-19 situation around the entire world in 3 seconds or less.

* View the latest COVID-19 data from John Hopkins University [GitHub repository]( https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data ) with interactive 3D
Provide entry-level programming code - plain-vanilla JavaScript - anybody can copy and make better
Display all the data in seconds on any device then zoom and rotate and click to see the cases in 3D

## Influences on the featurues

### [Issue #5 Expressions of hope]( https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider-covid-19-viz-3d/issues/5 )

> @loleg I'm not sure how best to describe this, but what I wish for in an interactive viz like this, is the ability to discover what's hot and happening "out there". For example, the home page of gitter.im has more or less live messages from around the world. I wonder if we could show positive tweets and expressions of hope and gratitude for the courage of health workers around the world.


Sky Box as an "Expression of Hope"

* Zoom out then rotate. Trying to read the messages is a little guessing game.
* The text is huge and leaves much white space. This is so you are not totally distracted while looking at the data.

Messages of hope to add

* “Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.”

### Burning Man / Wikd Wild West / Fair

Most of the time I try to create very simple, clean user experiences. Think Google's Material Design and Apple. I generally build tech stuff for techies.

But this is different. We want oldsters and children, tech and non-techies involved. We are seeing thus with painting abd drawing - a move from abstract to figurative, from minimal to pop-surreal.

The idea is to re-imagine the "chart", to turn the representation of quantities into more than mere the calligraphic scrawls we call "numbers".


### Love and Hate with the Earth as a globe

Some of the great things about the globe is that yoo know what to do with it. You can spin it, You know the top and bottom bits are kind of boring and not much happens there. You know where you live.

On the other hand, the Pacific Ocean takes half the space and there's nothing there eithr. And whenever ther places of interest there tend to be a ton of then and it's very difficult to attach a sign to one place without covering up the next place.

<summary>To do and wish list </summary>


### Generally

* Show some item of interest at the top of each indicator
	* As in all classical columns have a capital
	* Country or state flag?
	* Placards over each bar showing country & cases?
* Days since last new case indicated as color or opacity
* Community transmission vs traveller transmission
	* Data in WHO PDF file hard to parse
* a growing percentage affected per day of each country's population rather than cases detected if we're separating it out by country.
* Set limits so cannot go too far morth or south
* only show new cases and hide the other stats?

From Reddit

> Why do the death "black sleeves" look far bigger than the actual numbers suggest?

My answer
The actual reason is that - currently - the heights are scaled via a square root of the number in question. This means bigger numbers are drawn much smaller than they really are.

If this were a 2D chart -it would be easy to have gridlines and legends that indicated the scaling, but this is not so easy to show in 3D,

And therefore - as your sharp eyes have pointed out - the indicated relations between cases and deaths appear to be wacky. My bad.

I think a better idea might be to calculate the height of the cases and then calculate the height of the deaths as: casesHeight * deathCount / casesCount

***

>> new cases in the past day.
> divided by the new cases the previous day. More cases is interesting, but far more interesting (to me, anyway) is that if it's increasing.
> I'd suggest the derivative of the above as well, as I'd like to know if the rate of growth is increasing or decreasing, but I might be the only one that would find that interesting.

Medium Term

* Global statistics displayed in-world
* Translations with workflow for producing translations
* Better geoJson parser JavaScript function

Vision of the future

* new organization?
* separate timeline pages
* web pages for counties/provinces
* Add sound/music? During mouseover and at mouse click or data update
* Add text to speech commentary
* Refresh data every few minutes
* Add "expressions of hope" such as positive tweets?
* Sun path? Mountains? Flamingos and dolphins?
* Dark mode? Themes? Mid-century modern, Burner, pixelated
* Rotation + zoom - 3D Lissajous path
